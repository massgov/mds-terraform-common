Changelog
=========

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2018-12-13
### Changed
- [RDS Instance] Set sane defaults for the maintenance window, snapshot tagging, and deletion protection.
- [RDS Instance] Allow storage to be optionally encrypted.

## [0.8.0] - 2018-12-12
### Added
- [ECS Cluster] Add `schedule`, `schedule_down` and `schedule_up` properties, which control instance scheduling using the ASG scheduler.  Until we receive a config exception from EOTSS, these should be used in addition to the `schedulev2` tag (`instance_schedule` property).  Once the exception is granted, we should use `na` for the `schedulev2` tag, and exclusively use the ASG scheduling for all ASG instances. 

## [0.7.0] - 2018-12-11
### Added
- [ASG] Add `schedule`, `schedule_down` and `schedule_up` properties, which control instance scheduling using the ASG scheduler.  Until we receive a config exception from EOTSS, these should be used in addition to the `schedulev2` tag (`instance_schedule` property).  Once the exception is granted, we should use `na` for the `schedulev2` tag, and exclusively use the ASG scheduling for all ASG instances. 

## [0.6.0] - 2018-12-10
### Added
- [RDS Instance] Added RDS instance module to instantiate a single RDS instance (not appropriate for Aurora).

## [0.5.0] - 2018-12-05
### Added
- [Static] Static site module to manage an S3 static site that is only accessible via Cloudfront.

### Changed

## [0.4.0] - 2018-11-26

### Changed
- [ASG] Update to schedulerv2 tags to support EOTSS requirements.
