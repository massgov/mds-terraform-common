Chamber Policy
==============

This Terraform module renders IAM policies for reading or writing secrets stored with [Chamber](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber).

It does not create any resources on its own - it only provides outputs for IAM policies that can be attached to IAM users, roles, or groups.
