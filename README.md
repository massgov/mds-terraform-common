# Common Terraform Modules

This repository contains common Terraform modules that are used across the Massachussetts Digital Services infrastructure.

Each module should have:

* A `README.md` describing what the module does and how to use it.
* A `main.tf` file.
* A `variables.tf` file, if it takes input variables.
* An `outputs.tf` file, if it produces outputs.
